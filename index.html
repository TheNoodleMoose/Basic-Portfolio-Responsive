        <p>My name is Christian Huffman and I am in the process of becoming a full-stack developer! In high school, I
            discovered
            my passion for coding! It started out with simple arduino robots, programming them to navigate through a
            maze. At that moment
            I realized the power of code. I eventually dove into the world of HTML and CSS and things began to click
            even more.
            We use the internet every day to view and learn new things, and to be able to be apart of that and create
            is amazing!</p>
        <p>Ever since then I have had the desire to become a web developer! I love coding, video games, and learning!
            Coding and learning are a true passion of mine. I don't think there is anything more important than
            education and learning new things.
            And when I combine that with coding and web development I get something that I want to do for the rest of
            my life! I cannot
            wait to learn more and devlop some awesome projects! I WILL become a full-stack developer!</p>
